Tushan Temple gained widespread recognition due to a poem written by the great Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi, titled "Tushan’s Solitary Visit." The poem reads: "Walking alone on the wild path, with a scheduled stay at the monk’s quarters; Coming and going from Tushan, only the hooves of the horse know the way."
