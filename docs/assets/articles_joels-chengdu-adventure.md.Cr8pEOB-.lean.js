Using incubators, specialized formula feeding, and other cutting-edge technologies, the base overcame the challenges posed by her extremely low birth weight, showcasing humanity's remarkable achievements in wildlife conservation. The base boasts world-leading breeding technologies for giant pandas, including health management, disease prevention, and genetic resource preservation. By the end of 2023, the number of captive giant pandas at the base reached 244, and it also protects and breeds other endangered species such as red pandas, making it the global hub for the largest captive population of red pandas, with over 160 individuals.
