Shortly after their marriage, Yu bid farewell to his wife to manage the floods, leaving her for several years. Tushan is said to have waited by the Yangtze River for her husband’s return, missing him deeply and weeping continuously. Tushan Temple still stands on the mountain, recognized as the oldest temple in Chongqing, originally built during the Western Han Dynasty, and features the "Yu Wang Flood Control Stele." Tushan Temple gained widespread recognition due to a poem written by the great Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi, titled "Tushan’s Solitary Visit." The poem reads: "Walking alone on the wild path, with a scheduled stay at the monk’s quarters; Coming and going from Tushan, only the hooves of the horse know the way."
